    <h2>Highlighted Research Experiences</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Design a sharding protocol integrated with multiparty virtual payment channels:</b> 
        Designed cross-shard transaction protocols using payment channels and threshold signatures.
        We designed a sharding protocol integrated with multiparty virtual payment channels (MPCs) to enable secure and decentralized cross-shard transactions without relying on single-point intermediaries. 
        The protocol leverages a dynamically formed MPC group to maximize channel capacity and supports transactions involving multiple senders and receivers, thereby greatly improving blockchain transaction throughput.</li>
      <li><b>Designed an innovative distributed sharding protocol for blockchains:</b> 
        I proposed a novel sharding protocol that leverages payment channels to enable efficient cross-shard transactions, enhancing blockchain scalability and enabling distributed storage. 
        The protocol incorporates a threshold signature scheme to batch-sign messages for higher throughput and introduces an atomicity mechanism that ensures cross-shard consistency while achieving constant communication complexity O(1). 
        Compared to state-of-the-art protocols, it reduces latency by over 40%, offering a significant improvement in performance.
      </li>
      <li><b>Designed an optimal virtual payment channel (VPC) construction protocol:</b> 
        We designed a new metric to evaluate both the number of intermediaries and the capacity of constructed virtual payment channels (VPCs). 
        Building on a recursive VPC construction protocol starting from the minimal one-intermediary, two-party architecture, I optimized VPC construction for multiple user pairs using a game-theoretic algorithm.
      </li>
      <li><b>Designed an innovative rebalancing protocol for payment channel networks:</b> 
        We proposed a distributed balance-aware routing protocol that achieves high throughput while accounting for channel balances. 
        By modifying the original HTLC to improve efficiency and adapt it to balance-aware routing, the protocol guarantees atomicity of transactions. 
        Evaluations using real banking transaction history demonstrate a nearly 100% success ratio and success volume, highlighting its effectiveness.
